1) Made an ArrayList and added all the characters of String in it. Also took answer variable which stores '$' by default.
2) Ran a while loop until the list is completely empty.
3) Stored the first element of the list in temp (ArrayList of size 1) and removed that character from the original ArrayList.
4) Checked if that character(stored in temp) still exists
5) If it doesn't the that is the answer.
6) If it does then remove all the occurences of temp from original list and clear temp and repeat from step 3.
